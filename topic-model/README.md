# Topic Modeling and Polarity

Gensim's LDA was used to create the topic model for this project. 

The actual LDA model is in the model_data folder. It is trained for seven topics. 

<strong><u> NOTE </u> </strong>

The train_model script allows the user to either create their own model, or to use the current dictionary and corpus from the project to create another LDA model with a different topic parameter.

The dictionary can be found in the model_data folder. The corpus was too large to push, so Download it from the google drive link [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAQS4Nn38IwUmXBxTMwOUd-q8yiReqcJ)
